    <p>" I want to know what changed in fully modern humans, compared with Neanderthals, that made a difference. What
      made it possible for us to build up these enormous societies, and spread around the globe, and develop the
      technology that I think no one can doubt is unique to humans. " - Svante Pääbo</p>

      <h3>Svante Pääbo's Early Life</h4>
        <div class="earlylifeFlex ">
          <p>During his childhood in Sweden, Svante Pääbo developed a fascination with archeology, which only deepened
            after his mother, a chemist, took him to Egypt when he was 13. He wanted to be like Indiana Jones,
            discovering mummies and other ancient hidden treasures. “I had a very romantic idea of what archeology was,”
            he recalls. “But when I got to [Uppsala] University and started studying it, I found it wasn’t quite as
            romantic as I had imagined.”

            Pääbo switched from archeology to medicine, influenced, he says, by his father, the Nobel Prize-winning
            biochemist Sune Bergström. “At that time, if you were in Sweden and interested in basic biological research,
            you went to medical school,” says Pääbo. He enjoyed clinical medicine, but turned from his medical studies
            in 1981 to do doctoral research on adenoviruses and their interaction with the immune system. Yet he still
            had Egyptology on his mind. He wondered if it was possible to obtain DNA from archeological remains. At the
            time, scientists did not know if DNA could survive intact for a hundred let alone several thousand years.
            Without telling his PhD advisor (who Pääbo worried might not approve) and with the help of one of his former
            Egyptology professors, Pääbo obtained tissue samples from a German museum and went to work trying to isolate
            some DNA from them. His finding— he demonstration that DNA survived in the cell nuclei of some Egyptian
            mummies—was published in 1984 in a small East German journal, and then again a year later as the cover story
            in Nature.

            One of the scientists who read—and was impressed—with Pääbo’s work was the late evolutionary molecular
            biologist Allan Wilson at the University of California, Berkeley. Wilson had just announced that his lab had
            isolated a small section of DNA from a zebra-like animal known as a quagga, which had become extinct in the
            19th century. Wilson wrote to Pääbo to ask if he could do a sabbatical in Pääbo’s laboratory. “It was before
            the Internet,” laughs Pääbo. “He had no way of knowing that I didn’t have a lab, that I was just a graduate
            student.” Pääbo wrote back to explain the situation—and to ask for a postdoctoral position in Wilson’s lab.

    <div id="Research-and-Career">
      <h3>Svante Pääbo's Research and Career</h4>
        <p>Pääbo is known as one of the founders of paleogenetics, a discipline that uses genetics to study early humans
          and other ancient species.

          From 1986 to 1987, he did postdoctoral research at the Institute for Molecular Biology II, University of
          Zurich, Switzerland.

          As an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow, Pääbo moved to the United States in 1987, accepting a position as a
          postdoctoral researcher in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Allan
          Wilson's lab and worked on the genome of extinct mammals.

          In 1990, he returned to Europe to become professor of general biology at the University of Munich, and, in
          1997, he became founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,
          Germany.[28]

          In 1997, Pääbo and colleagues reported their successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
          originating from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto in the Neander valley.

          In August 2002, Pääbo's department published findings about the "language gene", FOXP2, which is mutated in
          some individuals with language disabilities.

          In 2006, Pääbo announced a plan to reconstruct the entire genome of Neanderthals. In 2007, he was named one of
          Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the year.

          In February 2009, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in
          Chicago, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had completed the first
          draft version of the Neanderthal genome. Over 3 billion base pairs were sequenced in collaboration with the
          454 Life Sciences Corporation.

          In March 2010, Pääbo and his coworkers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in the
          Denisova Cave in Siberia; the results suggest that the bone belonged to an extinct member of the genus Homo
          that had not yet been recognised, the Denisova hominin. Pääbo first wanted to classify the Denisovans as a
          species of their own, separate from modern humans and Neanderthals but changed his mind after peer-review.

          Pääbo's doctoral student Viviane Slon was able to successfully map the Denisovan genome, clarifying geographic
          distribution and admixtures in archaic humans.

          In May 2010, Pääbo and his colleagues published a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome in the journal
          Science. He and his team also concluded that there was probably interbreeding between Neanderthals and
          Eurasian (but not Sub-Saharan African) humans. There is general mainstream support in the scientific community
          for this theory of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans. This admixture of modern human and
          Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, in the Middle
          East.

          In 2014, he published the book Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes where he, in the mixed form of a
          memoir and popular science, tells the story of the research effort to map the Neanderthal genome combined with
          his thoughts on human evolution.

          In 2020, Pääbo determined that more severe impacts upon victims of the COVID-19 disease, including the
          vulnerability to it and the incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation, have been associated via DNA
          analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with
          European Neanderthal heritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more
          severe form of the disease. The findings are from Pääbo and researchers he leads at the Planck Institute and
          the Karolinska Institutet.</p>

      <h3>Svante Pääbo's Honours and Awards</h3>
      <p>In 1992, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the
        highest honour awarded in German research. Pääbo was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
        in 2000, and in 2004 was elected an international member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 2005, he
        received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine. In 2008, Pääbo was added to the members of the Order
        Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts. In the same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American
        Academy of Achievement. In October 2009, the Foundation For the Future announced that Pääbo had been awarded the
        2009 Kistler Prize for his work isolating and sequencing ancient DNA, beginning in 1984 with a 2,400-year-old
        mummy. In June 2010, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) awarded him the Theodor Bücher
        Medal for outstanding achievements in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In 2013, he received Gruber Prize in
        Genetics for groundbreaking research in evolutionary genetics. In June 2015, he was awarded the degree of DSc
        (honoris causa) at NUI Galway. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 2016, and in 2017, was
        awarded the Dan David Prize. In 2018, he received the Princess of Asturias Awards in the category of Scientific
        Research, in 2020 the Japan Prize, in 2021 the Massry Prize and in 2022 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
        Medicine for sequencing the first Neanderthal genome.</p>
